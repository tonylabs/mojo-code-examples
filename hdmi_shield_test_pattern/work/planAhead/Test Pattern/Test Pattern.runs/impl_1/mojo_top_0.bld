WARNING:NgdBuild:1440 - User specified non-default attribute value (10) was
   detected for the CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute on PLL "PLL_ADV".  This does not
   match the PERIOD constraint value (75 MHz.).  The uncertainty calculation
   will use the PERIOD constraint value.  This could result in incorrect
   uncertainty calculated for PLL output clocks.
